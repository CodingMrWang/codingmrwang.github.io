### <span style="color:red">Vim</span>

Vim is a really powerful text editor, when I had an internship in ByteDance, my leader kept encouraging me to use vim and stop using pycharm. So I decided to conclude those hot keys in vim and kept practicing it. This do speed up the workflow. All commands are searched from many blogs and offical website.


### Move Inside the whole program

```
k              move up one line
j              move down one line
h              move left one line
l              move right one line
```
move in a larger range

```
crtl+f         page down
crtl+b         page up
(              move to the start of current sentense
)              move to the start of next sentence
{              move to the start of current paragraph
}              move to the start of next paragraph
gg             move to the start of first line of the program
G              move to the start of last line of the program
NG or Ngg      move to the start of Nth line of the program
H              move to the first line of the screen
M              move to the middle of the screen
L              move to the end of the screen
*              search current word
```

### Move inside in one line

```
w              move to the start of next word
e              move to the end of current word
b              move to the start of the word before
0              move to the start of current line
^              move to the first none empty word
$              move to the end of current line
g_             move to the last non empty word
fx             move to the first x after current position
Nfx            move the the Nth x after current position
tx             move to the word begfore x
F and T        the opposite direction to f and t
```

### Search and match

```bash
/word          seach for the word in the program
n              go to next match word
N              go to last match word
```

### Replace and delete

```
rx             replace current letter with x
nrx            replace n letters after with x
x              remove current letter
nx             delete n letters after
dw             delete word on the right
ndw            delete n words on the right
db             delete word on the left
ndb            delete n words on the left
dd             delete current line and remove empty
ndd            delete and copy n lines
:s/old/new     replce first old with new in current line
:s/old/new/g   replace all old with new in current line
:%s/old/new/g  replace all old with new
:n1,n2s/old/new/g replace all old with new for n1 to n2 lines
:%s/^/xxx/g    add xxx to all lines head
:%s/$/xxx/g    add xxx to all lines tails
:%s/old/new/gc replace all old with new but need verification
```
### Edit
c is similar to d, the only difference is that c will become insrt mode after deletion.

```
s             delete current letter and start insert
ns            delete n letter to the right and start insert
S             delete current line and start insert
nS            delete n lines and start insert
cw            delete the word and start insert
cW or c$      delete the line to the right and start insert
ncw           delete n words to the right and start insert
cb            delete word to the left and start insert
ncb           delete n words to the left and start insert
cd            delete current line and start insert
ncd           delete n lines and start insert
c$            delete to the end of the line and start insert
c0            delete to the begin and start insert
```

### Copy and Paste

when you delete some words, they are actually saved to buffer

```
p            paste the content in buffer after the cursor
P            paste the content in the buffer before the cursor
yy           copy current line
nyy          copy n lines
"+yy         copy current line to system paste board
"+nyy        copy n lines to system paste board 
```

### Cancel and Repeat

.            repeat last command
:undo n      go back to n changes ago

```
