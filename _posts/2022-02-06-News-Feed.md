## What is Facebook's newsfeed?
A newsfeed is the constantly updating a list of stories in the middle of facebook's homepage. It includes status updates, photos, videos, links, app activity, and likes from people, pages and groups that a user follows on facebook.

## Requirements
### Functional requirements
- Register/Login
- User can post new feeds
- User can view timeline/news feed
- User can follow and unfollow a user

### Non Functional requirements
- Low latency
- Scability
- Reliability: user feeds data cannot loss
## Estimation
### Traffic
150M DAU
60 reads per day
1 write per day
### data size
1KB per feed
### QPS
read: 150M * 60/86400 = 100k/s
write: 150M/86400=2k/s
### Storage
post per year: 150 * 365 * 1kb = 60TB

## API
getUserFeed(user_id, since_id, max_id, count)
user_id: id of user for whom the system will generate the newsfeed.
sicne_id: return results with an ID higher than the ID
count: number of feeds want to retrieve
max_id: return results with an ID less than the id
return: Json containing a list of feed items

## Storage
- Relational database: MySQL
	- User table (not change frequently)
- NoSQL
	- Feeds
	- Social graph
- DFS
	- Socail media (CDN)
- Cache
	- cache hot feeds

## Database
User Table (Postgre)

|id|int|
|---|---|
|username|varchar|
|email|varchar|

Friendship Table (dynamoDB)

|from_user_id|
|---|
|to_user_id|
|created_at|

Post table (HBase)

|id|
|---|
|user_id|
|content|
|create_at|
|media_id|

Media service (S3)

## System design
- Pull model
	- when user check timeline, retrieve 100 news feed from all friends and do k sorted array merge
	- N times read
	- getNewsFeed
		- followings = DB.getFollowings(user = request.user)
		- for follow in followings:
			- posts = DB.getTweets(follow.to_user, 100)
			- news_feeds.merge(posts)
			- return news_feed[:100]
	- cons: at the beginning, long time to load timeline, especially when has many people to follow.
- Push Model
	- Create a list for each user to store news feed
	- when a user post a new post, it will be pushed to all followers news feed list
	- read = 1DB read
	- write = N DB writes (N is number of followers)
	- benefits; this can be done asynchronizely
	- cons: extra storage needed. For user has a lot of followers, a lot of writes.

- Pull model + Push model
	- for users which do not have a lot of followers, push post_id to follower's list, for users have a lot of followers, follower need to pull feeds from db.

## Improvement

Cache
For pull model
- cache each user's timeline
- cache each user's follow
- cache 100 feeds, return first 20 feeds

Push model
- cache timeline for each user
1000 * 8B * 100M = 800 GB

## Data Partitioning
Share feed data by user id.
If we use push model, we can shard timeline in cache by user id and shard post by post id.
