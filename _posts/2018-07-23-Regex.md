### Regular expression
Some offical website:

- [Search and Replace](https://docs.python.org/2/howto/regex.html#search-and-replace)
- [Compiling Regular Expressions](https://docs.python.org/2/howto/regex.html#compiling-regular-expressions)
- [Performing Matches](https://docs.python.org/2/howto/regex.html#performing-matches)

A really good regex online matching website

- [regex101](https://regex101.com/)

Below, I will record some regular expressions that I think are useful.

1. When you want to replace part of matching pattern
```python
import re
a = 'aaabbccc'
#replace the bb in the center to dd
re.sub('(a+)bb(c+)', '\\1dd\\2', a)
```
